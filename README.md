# 74LS47 Learning Board

## Overview
I designed this board to demonstrate how to use the 74LS47, so you do not have to waste extra GPIO for driving your display.

The board shows all the inputs and outputs of the IC, so they can be manipoulated to see what impact it has on operation. The output can be swapped from a set of LEDs to a 7-segment display. There is also an "auto" mode, where an AtTiny 85 increments through the BCD codes automatically. 

## Current Release
Version 1.1

## Current State
The 74Ls47 Learning Board is currently on hold. I have changes I want to make in the future but I do not know when I'll get to them.
